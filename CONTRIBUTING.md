# How to contribute
Cisco Network Elements support a rich set of features to make networks robust, efficient and secure. The GitHub project [cisco-network-puppet-module](https://github.com/cisco/cisco-network-puppet-module) defines a set of Puppet resource types and providers to manage the network element. Similarly, the GitHub project [cisco-network-chef-cookbook](https://github.com/cisco/cisco-network-chef-cookbook) defines a set of Chef resources and providers for network element management. The providers defined in these projects leverage a common set of Ruby API Objects defined in this project. This object set is expected to grow with contributions from Cisco, Cisco-Partners and third-party alike. Contributions to this project are welcome. To ensure code quality, contributors will be requested to follow few guidelines.
